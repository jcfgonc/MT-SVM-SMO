  title = {Rise of the Graphics Processor},

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {The modern graphics processing unit (GPU) is the result of 40 years
	of evolution of hardware to accelerate graphics processing operations.
	It represents the convergence of support for multiple market segments:
	computer-aided design, medical imaging, digital content creation,
	document and presentation applications, and entertainment applications.
	The exceptional performance characteristics of the GPU make it an
	attractive target for other application domains. We examine some
	of this evolution, look at the structure of a modern GPU, and discuss
	how graphics processing exploits this structure and how nongraphical
	applications can take advantage of this capability. We discuss some
	of the technical and market issues around broader adoption of this
	technology.}

  abstract = {{This paper presents a set of geometric signature features for offline
	automatic signature verification based on the description of the
	signature envelope and the interior stroke distribution in polar
	and Cartesian coordinates. The features have been calculated using
	16 bits fixed-point arithmetic and tested with different classifiers,
	such as hidden Markov models, support vector machines, and Euclidean
	distance classifier. The experiments have shown promising results
	in the task of discriminating random and simple forgeries.}}

	unit (GPU) for the PC industry the NVIDIA GeForce 256. The technical
	definition of a GPU is "a single-chip processor with integrated transform,
	lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines that is
	capable of processing a minimum of 10 million polygons per second."
	With transform, lighting, setup, and rendering on a single GPU, the
	GeForce 256 delivers 15M polygons/second and 480M pixels/second of
	performance. Truly revolutionary, its unique 256-bit rendering engine
	enabled an order of magnitude increase in visual complexity, and
	helped to set the stage for the future of realism in graphics.},

  title = {{GPU} Computing},
  journal = {Vol. 96, No. 5, May 2008 | Proceedings of the IEEE},
  year = {2008},
  abstract = {The graphics processing unit (GPU) has become an integral part of
	today's mainstream computing systems. Over the past six years, there
	has been a marked increase in the performance and capabilities of
	GPUs. The modern GPU is not only a powerful graphics engine but also
	a highly parallel programmable processor featuring peak arithmetic
	and memory bandwidth that substantially outpaces its CPU counterpart.
	The GPUs rapid increase in both programmability and capability has
	spawned a research community that has successfully mapped a broad
	range of computationally demanding, complex problems to the GPU.
	This effort in generalpurpose computing on the GPU, also known as
	GPU computing, has positioned the GPU as a compelling alternative
	to traditional microprocessors in high-performance computer systems
	of the future. We describe the background, hardware, and programming
	model for GPU computing, summarize the state of the art in tools
	and techniques, and present four GPU computing successes in game
	physics and computational biophysics that deliver order-of-magnitude
	performance gains over optimized CPU applications.}

  abstract = {At this year's Consumer Electronics Show, NVIDIA had several things
	going on. In a public press conference they announced 3D Vision Surround
	and Tegra 2, while on the showfloor they had products oplenty, including
	a GF100 setup showcasing 3D Vision Surround.
	
	
	But if youre here, then what youre most interested in is what wasnt
	talked about in public, and that was GF100. With the Fermi-based
	GF100 GPU finally in full production, NVIDIA was ready to talk to
	the press about the rest of GF100, and at the tail-end of CES we
	got our first look at GF100s gaming abilities, along with a hands-on
	look at some unknown GF100 products in action. The message NVIDIA
	was trying to send: GF100 is going to be here soon, and its going
	to be fast.},
